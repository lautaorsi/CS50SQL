# CS50SQL
This is a SQL course I am currently enrolled in where I learn querying, CRUD operations, database creation and visualization, optimization and scaling. <br>
I am interested in seeing the intersection between databases and cybersecurity as well as using it for pretty much all of my projects. Understanding how we store information in large amounts is crucial for a good software design<br>
